  <div class="fr-view u-clearfix u-rich-text u-text u-block-3830-4"><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Machine learning and it's aspects</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which enables a program(software) to learn from the experiences and improve their self at a task without being explicitly programmed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">How machine learning works?</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">A machine learning model learns from the historical data fed to it and then builds prediction algorithms to predict the output for the new set of data the comes in as input to the system. The accuracy of these models would depend on the quality and amount of input data. A large amount of data will help build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Suppose we have a complex problem at hand that requires to perform some predictions. Now, instead of writing a code, this problem could be solved by feeding the given data to generic machine learning algorithms. With the help of these algorithms, the machine will develop logic and predict the output. Machine learning has transformed the way we approach business and social problems. Below is a diagram that briefly explains the working of a machine learning model/ algorithm. our way of thinking about the problem.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">History of Machine Learning</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Nowadays, we can see some amazing applications of ML such as in self-driving cars, Natural Language Processing and many more. But Machine learning has been here for over 70 years now. It all started in 1943, when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper about neurons, and how they work. They decided to create a model of this using an electrical circuit, and therefore, the neural network was born.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In 1950, Alan Turing created the “Turing Test” to determine if a computer has real intelligence. To pass the test, a computer must be able to fool a human into believing it is also human. In 1952, Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer learning program. The program was the game of checkers, and the IBM computer improved at the game the more it played, studying which moves made up winning strategies and incorporating those moves into its program.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Just after a few years, in 1957, Frank Rosenblatt designed the first neural network for computers (the perceptron), which simulates the thought processes of the human brain. Later, in 1967, the “nearest neighbour” algorithm was written, allowing computers to begin using very basic pattern recognition. This could be used to map a route for travelling salesmen, starting at a random city but ensuring they visit all cities during a short tour.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">But we can say that in the 1990s we saw a big change. Now work on machine learning shifted from a knowledge-driven approach to a data-driven approach. &nbsp;Scientists began to create programs for computers to analyze large amounts of data and draw conclusions or “learn” from the results.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion. Deep Blue used the computing power in the 1990s to perform large-scale searches of potential moves and select the best move. Just a decade before this, in 2006, Geoffrey Hinton created the term “deep learning” to explain new algorithms that help computers distinguish objects and text in images and videos.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Features of Machine Learning</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Automation: Nowadays in your Gmail account, there is a spam folder that contains all the spam emails. You might be wondering how does Gmail know that all these emails are spam? This is the work of Machine Learning. It recognises the spam emails and thus, it is easy to automate this process. The ability to automate repetitive tasks is one of the biggest characteristics of machine learning. A huge number of organizations are already using machine learning-powered paperwork and email automation. In the financial sector, for example, a huge number of repetitive, data-heavy and predictable tasks are needed to be performed. Because of this, this sector uses different types of machine learning solutions to a great extent.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Improved customer experience: For any business, one of the most crucial ways to drive engagement, promote brand loyalty and establish long-lasting customer relationships is by providing a customized experience and providing better services. Machine Learning helps us to achieve both of them. Have you ever noticed that whenever you open any shopping site or see any ads on the internet, they are mostly about something that you recently searched for? This is because machine learning has enabled us to make amazing recommendation systems that are accurate. They help us customize the user experience. Now coming to the service, most of the companies nowadays have a chatting bot with them that are available 24×7. An example of this is Eva from AirAsia airlines. These bots provide intelligent answers and sometimes you might even not notice that you are having a conversation with a bot. These bots use Machine Learning, which helps them to provide a good user experience.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Automated data visualization: In the past, we have seen a huge amount of data being generated by companies and individuals. Take an example of companies like Google, Twitter, Facebook. How much data are they generating per day? We can use this data and visualize the notable relationships, thus giving businesses the ability to make better decisions that can actually benefit both companies as well as customers. With the help of user-friendly automated data visualization platforms such as AutoViz, businesses can obtain a wealth of new insights in an effort to increase productivity in their processes.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Business intelligence: Machine learning characteristics, when merged with big data analytics can help companies to find solutions to the problems that can help the businesses to grow and generate more profit. From retail to financial services to healthcare, and many more, ML has already become one of the most effective technologies to boost business operations.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Python provides flexibility in choosing between object-oriented programming or scripting. There is also no need to recompile the code; developers can implement any changes and instantly see the results. You can use Python along with other languages to achieve the desired functionality and results. Python is a versatile programming language and can run on any platform including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Unix, and others. While migrating from one platform to another, the code needs some minor adaptations and changes, and it is ready to work on the new platform.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Types of Machine learning</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">i)Supervised Learning</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In Supervised Learning, we have two sets of variables. One is called the target variable, or labels (the variable we want to predict) and features(variables that help us to predict target variables). We show the program(model) the features and the label associated with these features and then the program is able to find the underlying pattern in the data.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">ii)Unsupervised Learning</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">This approach is the one where we have no target variables, and we have only the input variable(features) at hand. The algorithm learns by itself and discovers an impressive structure in the data. The goal is to decipher the underlying distribution in the data to gain more knowledge about the data.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">We can group the unsupervised learning problems as:</li></ul><ol><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Clustering: This means bundling the input variables with the same characteristics together. E.g., grouping users based on search history</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Association: Here, we discover the rules that govern meaningful associations among the data set. E.g., People who watch ‘X’ will also watch ‘Y’.</li></ol><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">iii)Reinforcement Learning</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In this approach, machine learning models are trained to make a series of decisions based on the rewards and feedback they receive for their actions. The machine learns to achieve a goal in complex and uncertain situations and is rewarded each time it achieves it during the learning period.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Reinforcement learning is different from supervised learning in the sense that there is no answer available, so the reinforcement agent decides the steps to perform a task. The machine learns from its own experiences when there is no training data set present.</li></ul></div>
