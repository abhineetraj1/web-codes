  <div class="fr-view u-clearfix u-rich-text u-text u-block-ede5-4"><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Internet of Behavior</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Internet of Behavior, also known as IoB, refers to the behavioral data analysis gathered from the Internet of Things and other sources and then attempts to make effective use of. This data is amassed through wearable technologies, individual online activities, household electrical devices, which can provide valuable information about the behavior and interest of users.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;Applications of IOB</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">There are lots of applications of IoB you can explore in 2021 and apply in your own context. Most businesses are utilizing online advertising as an effective way to reach more customers in the present age.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">However, the Internet of Behavior is making them able to identify and target to target specific individuals or groups that can benefit from their services and products.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">For example, both Facebook and Google are using the behavioral data of their users to display advertisements to the people accordingly. This is helping businesses in getting connected with their potential audience as well as track their behaviors towards their ads via click-through rate.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Similarly, YouTube is also utilizing behavioral analytics to improve the experience of its viewers. By tracking behavioral data, it is recommending users’ videos and shows which they are more interested in.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Even more, the latest technologies such as Siri, Google Home, and Alexa also study and interpret the data and behavior of the user to work more efficiently.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;IoB Value Across Industries</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Location Tracking and Consumer Behavior</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Do you often instantly get a request from the restaurant you just left to drop a review on Google or Yelp? That is how your preference is extracted. This is the same logic Uber applies to find out about their customers’ experiences and develop better strategies to cater to them.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Most location-based services use the mobile phone’s GPS technology or other techniques like near-field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth to track the user’s location and send notifications or emails accordingly.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">This also helps gather information in real-time rather than after a delayed period, which helps companies make changes to their offerings rapidly.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Facial Detection and Physical Status</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">In 2018, coffee chain Barista started using IoB for facial recognition to determine their consumers’ gender, age, and mood. The technology helps them observe the results and suggest an appropriate drink for the customer.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The same system can be used in retail stores for personalized advertising wherein the brands offer products or services based on their mood or gender.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Product recommendations, pioneered by Amazon, studies the buyer history to suggest products. Facial recognition does the same but by reviewing the current state of the consumer.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Health Monitoring for Patient Recovery</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">IoB is now used in creating health apps for smartphones that can track a person’s diet, blood sugar level, heart rates, and sleep patterns.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Plus, it can warn a patient about their current health condition, suggest that they take it easy, and modify their eating habits or medicine intake accordingly. This essential information can save lives and help doctors diagnose illnesses and start proper treatment faster.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Social Credit Score System and Tracking Citizen Behavior</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Remember when China introduced its social credit score system that keeps track of how its citizens behave and assigns scores based on their behavior? Forgot to pay the electricity bill? Minus points. Put up an anti-government social media post? Minus points.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Well, they plan to apply the IoB technology on a massive scale. They aim to make it possible for them to track their citizens’ loyalty to the current regime.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">IoB can therefore help businesses and governments monitor the public, keep crime under control, provide necessary services, and basically implement a safer and more organized way of living.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Chronic Disease Tracking</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The past decade or two has seen an unprecedented rise in chronic and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Every year, nearly 41 million people die from NCDs, which also leads to excessive healthcare spending.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">IoB offers a promising approach to develop real-time remote health monitoring systems for BCD patients, mainly suffering from heart patients and diabetics. IoB-enabled devices have made great strides possible in artificial pancreas technology.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Monitoring vital signs helps reduce hospitalization by detecting anomalies in the patient’s body and alerting them that they need to see a doctor at the earliest. A 2015 study shows that IoB devices have led to a 50% reduction in the 30-day hospital readmission rate.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Travel Booking</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Travel companies can make customized and relevant offers and recommendations by studying consumers’ social-demographic characteristics and past online behavior. Booking.com, for instance, enables customers to book hotels, resorts, and staycation accommodations at a specific destination.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">To optimize the in-app browsing experience, the app continuously learns and studies the data to provide personalized hotel destination suggestions.</li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">&nbsp;IoB Use Cases</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">By tracking a person’s geographical location, you can see if they have visited a beauty salon or a supermarket, along with the length of their stay. Businesses can accordingly send marketing messages, promotional offers, and discounts to drive sales and offer a sublime shopping experience to their customers.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Going back to China’s social credit score system, the country intends to track its citizens’ loyalty to the current regime through systematic data collection and analysis. This is the first time that any government has planned to use behavioral analysis on such a grand scale.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">During the pandemic, many computer vision companies, began using IoB to identify whether or not a citizen was wearing a mask. In the same case, thermal fingers were used to determine people with increased body temperatures (potentially a COVID-19 case).</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As mentioned previously, Barista deploys IoB for facial recognition to determine the gender, age, and mood of their consumers and offer them an appropriate beverage based on their analysis. The same system can do very well in personalized advertising.</li></ul></div>
