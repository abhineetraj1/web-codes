  <div class="fr-view u-clearfix u-rich-text u-text u-block-5f69-4"><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Edge computing</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">It is a distributed information technology (IT) architecture in which client data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Edge computing puts storage and servers where the data is, often requiring little more than a partial rack of gear to operate on the remote LAN to collect and process the data locally. In many cases, the computing gear is deployed in shielded or hardened enclosures to protect the gear from extremes of temperature, moisture and other environmental conditions. Processing often involves normalizing and analyzing the data stream to look for business intelligence, and only the results of the analysis are sent back to the principal data center.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The idea of business intelligence can vary dramatically. Some examples include retail environments where video surveillance of the showroom floor might be combined with actual sales data to determine the most desirable product configuration or consumer demand. Other examples involve predictive analytics that can guide equipment maintenance and repair before actual defects or failures occur. Still other examples are often aligned with utilities, such as water treatment or electricity generation, to ensure that equipment is functioning properly and to maintain the quality of output.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Edge computing use cases and examples</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Manufacturing.</span> An industrial manufacturer deployed edge computing to monitor manufacturing, enabling real-time analytics and machine learning at the edge to find production errors and improve product manufacturing quality. Edge computing supported the addition of environmental sensors throughout the manufacturing plant, providing insight into how each product component is assembled and stored -- and how long the components remain in stock. The manufacturer can now make faster and more accurate business decisions regarding the factory facility and manufacturing operations.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Farming</span>. Consider a business that grows crops indoors without sunlight, soil or pesticides. The process reduces grow times by more than 60%. Using sensors enables the business to track water use, nutrient density and determine optimal harvest. Data is collected and analyzed to find the effects of environmental factors and continually improve the crop growing algorithms and ensure that crops are harvested in peak condition.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Network optimization.</span> Edge computing can help optimize network performance by measuring performance for users across the internet and then employing analytics to determine the most reliable, low-latency network path for each user's traffic. In effect, edge computing is used to "steer" traffic across the network for optimal time-sensitive traffic performance.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Workplace safety</span>. Edge computing can combine and analyze data from on-site cameras, employee safety devices and various other sensors to help businesses oversee workplace conditions or ensure that employees follow established safety protocols -- especially when the workplace is remote or unusually dangerous, such as construction sites or oil rigs.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Improved healthcare.</span> The healthcare industry has dramatically expanded the amount of patient data collected from devices, sensors and other medical equipment. That enormous data volume requires edge computing to apply automation and machine learning to access the data, ignore "normal" data and identify problem data so that clinicians can take immediate action to help patients avoid health incidents in real time.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Transportation.</span> Autonomous vehicles require and produce anywhere from 5 TB to 20 TB per day, gathering information about location, speed, vehicle condition, road conditions, traffic conditions and other vehicles. And the data must be aggregated and analyzed in real time, while the vehicle is in motion. This requires significant onboard computing -- each autonomous vehicle becomes an "edge." In addition, the data can help authorities and businesses manage vehicle fleets based on actual conditions on the ground.</li><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Retail.</span> Retail businesses can also produce enormous data volumes from surveillance, stock tracking, sales data and other real-time business details. Edge computing can help analyze this diverse data and identify business opportunities, such as an effective endcap or campaign, predict sales and optimize vendor ordering, and so on. Since retail businesses can vary dramatically in local environments, edge computing can be an effective solution for local processing at each store.</li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.5rem;">Why is edge computing important?</span></p><ul><li style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Computing tasks demand suitable architectures, and the architecture that suits one type of computing task doesn't necessarily fit all types of computing tasks. Edge computing has emerged as a viable and important architecture that supports distributed computing to deploy compute and storage resources closer to -- ideally in the same physical location as -- the data source. In general, distributed computing models are hardly new, and the concepts of remote offices, branch offices, data center colocation and cloud computing have a long and proven track record.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">But decentralization can be challenging, demanding high levels of monitoring and control that are easily overlooked when moving away from a traditional centralized computing model. Edge computing has become relevant because it offers an effective solution to emerging network problems associated with moving enormous volumes of data that today's organizations produce and consume. It's not just a problem of amount. It's also a matter of time; applications depend on processing and responses that are increasingly time-sensitive.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul></div>
